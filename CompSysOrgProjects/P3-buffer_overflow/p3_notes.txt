load egg into memory (shellAddr)
Put program couter at ShellAddr 


modify return address? 

 -  get to return address and modify to point to nex place over and put your shell code there 

to get the shell code to memory, print what goes into memory

shellcode is part of the inpnut and this is all part oa print statement

find where return address is

____________________________________________

run c code and place breakpoint at fgets statement 

(gdb) i f --> important --> This shows us where the previous frame's stack pointer is stored, and where the "helper" function has saved the return address register ("rip at 0x7ff...." (exact address varies) right under "Saved registers:").

(gdb) i x/4xg buff -> prints 4 words (?) around where the starting address of the buffer is --> you can use this to get the start for the buffer and you know where you need to go using the i f function   

the addresses of teh x/4xg are what is important

you know where i f is stored based on i f 

start of return address and start of buffer are needed 

previous stack pointer from i f gives you return address



PART2____________________________________________________________

0x7fffffffd9d8


padding is 10 bytes 

e290 -  e280 = 16 

buffer is above memory 

ovewrite main's rip becasue it is higher is memory

e2e8
e2e0

22 integers is 88 bytes
__________________________________

d9d0 / d9e0 --> this is ibuff
da38

2616 - 2512 = 104


d9be --> this is strbuff 
da38 --> 2616 - 2494 = 122

trial and error for 3 using %
