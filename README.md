# Class-Assignments
This is a conglomerate of class projects from Functional Programming, Introduction to Machine Learning, Algorithms, and Foundations of Robotics


Description of Project/Assignment Folders:

_________________________________________________


Functional Programming: 

 I did not write the skeleton of these files.  I only filled in the implementation of required functions. 
  
*  Enigma: Implementation of a basic enigma machine similar t the functionality of those uused in WWII. 
  
*  Adventure: Implementation of a text adventure game using a text based interface in terminal.
  
*  Search:  Devleop a search engine for text documents which utilizes differnt dictionary implementations to search for documents.  
  
*  RML: Build an interpretter for a simplified Ocaml language called RML (Robot Meta-Language)
  
____________________________________________________

Algorithms:

* This folder contains coding problems where we had to constrct time eficient algorithms in java to corresponding to a given prompt which I have also included in the folder.  This algorithms were written by scratch without any starter code.

Machine Learning:  

 I did not write the skeleton of these files.  I only filled in the implementation of the ML algorithms. 

* Kaggle Competition: Design a Machine learning model from scratch to predict if a dog's leg is lame from gait anayysis data

*  P1: use K-nearest neighbors classifiers to build a basic classifier for face recognition
  
*  P2:implement a simple Perceptron classifier to classify digits
  
*  P3: Create a system that detects every time a word is German and translates it for you in the subtitles. In this project, you will just implement the first part of this system using Na√Øve Bayes to predict if a word is German or English
  
*  P4: Utilize the adagrad gradient descent algorithm with different loss function (ridge, logistic and hinge) to build a spam filter
  
*  P5: Computing bias, variance, and noise for datasets and showing the affects of regularizers on prediction models
  
*  P6: Implement a linear support vector machine and one operating in kernel space utilizing pytorch
  
*  P7: Implement a decision tree algorithm and then use it for bagging and boosting
  
*  P8: Implement a some neural networks to solve regression and image classification problems using pytorch
