# Class-Assignments
This is a conglomerate of class projects from Functional Programming, Introduction to Machine Learning, Algorithms, and Foundations of Robotics.  Languages used include python, java, and ocaml.  


## Description of Project/Assignment Folders:

_________________________________________________


Functional Programming: 

 I did not write the skeleton of these files.  I only filled in the implementation of required functions. 
  
*  project1: Implementation of a basic enigma machine similar to the functionality of those used in WWII. 
*  project2: Implementation of a text adventure game using a text-based interface in terminal.
*  project3:  Devleop a search engine for text documents which utilizes differnt dictionary implementations to search for documents.  
*  project4: Build an interpretter for a simplified Ocaml language called Robot Meta-Language

Algorithms:

* This folder contains multiple coding problems where we had to constrct time eficient algorithms in java corresponding to a given prompt which Iincluded in the directory.  This algorithms were written by scratch without any starter code in Java.

Machine Learning:  

 I did not write the skeleton of these files.  I only filled in the implementation of the ML algorithms. 

* P1: Used K-nearest neighbors classifiers to build a basic classifier for face recognition
* P2: Implemented a simple Perceptron classifier to classify digits
* P3: Create a system that detects every time a word is German and translates it for you in the subtitles. In this project, you will just implement the first part of this system using Na√Øve Bayes to predict if a word is German or English
* P4: Utilize the adagrad gradient descent algorithm with different loss functions (ridge, logistic and hinge) to build a spam filter
* P5: Computing bias, variance, and noise for datasets and showing the effects of regularizers on prediction models
* P6: Implement a linear support vector machine and one operating in kernel space utilizing PyTorch
* P7: Implement a decision tree algorithm and then use it for bagging and boosting
* P8: Implement a couple basic neural network to solve regression and image classification problems using PyTorch
* Kaggle Competition: Design a Machine learning model from scratch to predict if a dog's leg is lame from gait analysis data

Computer System Org: 

For projects 3, 4, and 5, I did not write all of the code in these files.  A skeleton was given to us.

* P1: Built and tested a riscv arithmetic logical unit within a logic circuit simulator (logisim).
* P2: Build and tested a riscv CPU within a logic circuit simulator (logisim).
* P3: Performed buffer overflow and other attacks on faulty written C programs to exploit their vulnerabilities.
* P4: Implement a partial riscv interpreter in C in which memory is simulated as a hashtable with chaining (using linked lists).
* P5: Implement a simulation of a cache utilizing VI and MSI protocols and analyzed the performance of the simulators.
